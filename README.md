🌾 Welcome to Grainly Crops — Your Crop Price Chart Bot
📝 Problem Statement

Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy, but farmers face uncertainty in crop prices due to seasonal variations, demand-supply imbalance, weather conditions, and market fluctuations. This unpredictability leads to financial instability and makes it hard for farmers to plan crop selection and marketing strategies.

💡 Solution

Grainly Crops is an AI-powered Chart Bot that predicts crop prices using a hybrid LSTM + Random Forest model. It analyzes historical prices, rainfall, temperature, demand trends, and other factors to generate interactive charts and actionable insights. Farmers can query prices for specific crops and locations and get easy-to-understand visualizations and suggestions for optimal selling or storage.
